Harsh Vardhan Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. It is a minimal, professional, multi-page React application built with Tailwind CSS, React Router, and Framer Motion animations. The site is optimized for deployment on Netlify.

The portfolio includes three main sections:

Home: A brief introduction and career objective

About Me: Experience and education

My Work: Projects, personal projects, and freelance work

The design focuses on clarity, readability, and modern UI principles.

Clean and structured multi-page layout using React Router

Animated components using Framer Motion

Card-based content sections

Reusable components for navigation and footer

Contact button included on every page

Subtle design elements such as a soft background blob
